**Problem:** Doing `git push`, runs as usual up to `Writing objects: ...`, then got this error:

```
error: RPC failed; result=56, HTTP code = 200
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

**Solution:** Increase git buffer configuration.

```sh
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
```

Exact cause is unknown because Iâ€™ve pushed from the same connection and device many times and never got this error before.
