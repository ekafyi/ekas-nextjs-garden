I use this whenever I needed to download a specific directory but I'm on a slow connection and the whole repository is _waaay too large_ and takes too long to clone. ðŸ˜«

Install [Gyumeijie/github-files-fetcher](https://github.com/Gyumeijie/github-files-fetcher) as a global package.

```sh
npm install -g github-files-fetcher
```

Usage example:

```sh
fetcher --url="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-blog/" --out=/Users/eka
```

- Download only the directory specified in `--url`.
- Download to the directory specified in `--out`.

Donâ€™t forget the trailing slash `/` if you are downloading a subdirectory.

This package is also available as a browser extension if you prefer doing this from the browser.
