**Problem:** All of a sudden I cannot merge from a branch (let‚Äôs call it `my-working-branch`) to the current branch.

Both `git merge my-working-branch` and `git pull origin my-working-branch` (the working branch has been pushed) returns `Already up to date.`. Creating a new PR indicates the branches are identical.

The files in both branches _are_ different, both on local and remote as seen in the web-based Github repo.

**Solution:** `git checkout my-working-branch -- .`

Changed files are staged into the current branch. You have to add and commit these files to this branch instead of having the original commits merged here.

WTF. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

No time/energy to investigate the cause/explanation. Additional background info:

- Never happened before to me; once fixed has not happened again so far.
- Happened once to my colleague working on the same codebase.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: `git checkout` overrides uncommitted changes so make sure to commit/stash changes you want to retain.
