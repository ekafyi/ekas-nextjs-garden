**Problem:** All of a sudden I cannot merge from a branch (let’s call it `my-working-branch`) to the current branch.

Both `git merge my-working-branch` and `git pull origin my-working-branch` (the working branch has been pushed) returns `Already up to date.`.

The files in both branches _are_ different, both on local and remote as seen in the web-based Github repo.

**Solution:** `git checkout my-working-branch -- .`

Changed files are staged into the current branch. You have to add and commit these files to this branch instead of having the original commits merged here.

WTF. 🤷🏽‍♀️

No time/energy to investigate the cause further, just taking a note here.

⚠️ Warning: `git checkout` overrides uncommitted changes so make sure to commit/stash changes you want to retain.
