Trying out the `useImage` hook from the `use-cloudinary` library ([repo](https://github.com/domitriusclark/use-cloudinary) | [docs](https://use-cloudinary.netlify.app/)). I copied the `Image` component from the [documentation page](https://use-cloudinary.netlify.app/usage/use-image/) sample code. Let‚Äôs go!

## Basic usage

(1) no `width`, `height`, or `transformations` props

```jsx
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
/>
```

- **expectation:** original size
- **rendered:** `c_scale,f_auto,q_auto/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg` ‚úÖ as expected

---

(2) `width` only

```jsx
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
  width={300}
/>
```

- **expectation:** auto height
- **rendered:** `c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg` ‚úÖ as expected

---

(3) `height` only

```jsx
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
  height={480}
/>
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ekafyi/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,h_480,q_auto/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg)

- **expectation:** auto width
- **rendered:** `c_scale,f_auto,h_480,q_auto/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg` ‚úÖ as expected

---

## Customizations

(4) `width` and `height` props

```jsx
// ‚ùå stretched image, don't copy
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
  width={300}
  height={200}
/>
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ekafyi/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,h_200,q_auto,w_300/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg)

- Would be cool if it auto-crops/fits, but my guess is we'll have to use the `transformations` props.
- **rendered:** `c_scale,f_auto,h_200,q_auto,w_300/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg` (heheheh stretchy cat)

---

(5) `width`, `height`, and `transformations` props

As per the [Cloudinary docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformation_reference#crop_parameter), `crop: 'fill'` is what we need to _‚ÄúCreate an image with the exact given width and height without distorting the image.‚Äù_

```jsx
// ‚ùå stretched image, don't copy
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
  width={300}
  height={200}
  transformations={{ crop: "fill" }}
/>
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ekafyi/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,h_200,q_auto,w_300/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg)

ü§î The `transformations` props does not take effect, and we still get the same image `c_scale,f_auto,h_200,q_auto,w_300/v1/samples/animals/cat.jpg`.

I then try (5b), moving the desired width and height to the `transformations` props. Still does not work; renders the same image as above.

```jsx
// ‚ùå stretched image, don't copy
<Image
  // cloudName
  publicId="samples/animals/cat.jpg"
  transformations={{ crop: "fill", width: 300, height: 200 }}
/>
```

On inspecting the source code, I found this possibly relevant part: https://github.com/domitriusclark/use-cloudinary/blob/e913c6ff572a37a0dd0e9bdfdb41114db29f6873/src/hooks/useImage/index.js#L49-L50

`crop: 'scale'` is applied by default if the below condition is met. I'm not sure why this is still applied even when I _do_ pass `crop` in the `transformations` though.

I tried various other `crop` values (`pad`, `crop`, etc) as well as `crop`, `width`, and `aspect_ratio` combinations out of curiousity, but they all did not take effect, ie. still yield `c_scale` (`crop: "scale"`) URL.

---

## Conclusion

The `useImage` hook works well out of the box for basic usage. Maybe I used it incorrectly, but I failed to get it to work when customizing the `crop` value. As such, it's _not_ possible to crop an image of unknown/arbitrary aspect ratio into, say, 300x200px with this library. If this is the use case you need, Cloudinary also has a [large list of SDKs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/framework_integration) that you can look into.
