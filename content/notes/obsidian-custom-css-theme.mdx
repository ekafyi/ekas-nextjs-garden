We can customize the Obsidian UI to our heart&#39;s content with the _Custom CSS_ plugin!

1. Settings (bottom left corner) → Plugin → check Custom CSS
2. Settings → Appearance → check Custom CSS
3. Add `obsidian.css` to your vault's root directory. If the CSS file is not present, default UI is shown.

Roll your own or pick (or modify) from the cool themes here: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-css-themes/76

I currently use [obsidian-atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) and loving it.
