I joined the GraphQL cohort in the Party Corgi Discord! We’re going to learn GraphQL by watching the videos in [howtographql.com](http://howtographql.com/) and doing weekly group discussions in voice chat.

I’m not a complete beginner, having used GraphQL with Gatsby before. But i only have a superficial understanding of it so far, only reading as far as the tasks i needed to do. It makes me not confident and unsure how to use it outside of Gatsby’s built-in GraphQL setup.

Joining this cohort gives me a chance to learn GraphQL from the basics, with the benefits of accountability and fun from the social side.

> At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.
